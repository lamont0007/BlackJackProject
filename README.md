# BlackJackProject
# Description
This project was very challenging.  With being introduce to StringBuilder made it that more complicated.
#Technologies Used
Eclipse, Google
#Lessons Learned
I learned that it takes the right approach to conquer Java.
My TA John has drill in me the proper way of calling and building methods.
My Tutor Richard showed me the proper way to approach this project and also introduce StringBuilder to me.  Stringbuilder is a built in class that helps to modify and concatenate string; meaning it just basically there for joining strings together; thats why you can see "builder.append(card).append(", ");" which appends the card together and separates it with "comma" .StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); this line creates a new instance of the string builder class which gives us access to use the append() method to modify and concatenate string
